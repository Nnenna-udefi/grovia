              Many clients struggle with unreliable contractors who cause
              delays, go over budget, or deliver poor workmanship.

              Rapid urban development has increased demand for high-quality yet
              affordable construction but many firms fall short on efficiency,
              innovation, and professionalism.
            </li>
            <li>
              Clients often lack transparency into the construction process,
              leading to frustration and mistrust.
